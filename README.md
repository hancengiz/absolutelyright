# absolutelyright.lol

A scientifically rigorous tracking system for how often Claude Code validates my life choices.

Currently tracking:
- Times Claude Code said I'm "absolutely right"
- Times Claude Code said I'm just "right" (meh)

Built with imposter syndrome and Rust.

```bash
cargo run
# visit http://localhost:3003
```

That's it. That's the README.
